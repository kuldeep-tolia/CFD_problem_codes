Problem Description:  

-> For this problem, consider a steady transport of a scalar $\phi$ by advection-diffusion equation inside a square domain of side $L$.  
-> The governing equation can be written as:

$$\nabla \cdot \left( \rho \vec{v}\phi \right) = \nabla \cdot \left( \Gamma \nabla \phi \right) + S$$
