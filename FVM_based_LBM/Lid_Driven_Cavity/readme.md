Problem Description:  

-> Flow inside a Lid-Driven square cavity is a classical benchmark problem for incompressible viscous flow.  
-> The size of the 2-D square cavity, normalised using the side length of square cavity $H$, is 1 x 1 in $x$ and $y$ directions, respectively.  
-> All the boundaries are prescribed with no-slip boundary condition, where the top boundary translates with constant velocity $U$ (in $x$-direction) and others are stationary.  
-> The Reynolds number can be defined as $Re = U H / \nu$, where $\nu \equiv$ kinematic viscosity of the fluid.  
-> Two different Reynolds number ($Re = 100, 400$) are studied and validated with the benchmark results.  
-> The flow is laminar and steady in this regime.
