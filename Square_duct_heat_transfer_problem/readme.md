Problem Description:  
  
-> For this problem, consider a flow that is hydrodynamically and thermally fully developed inside a square duct of side $L$.  
-> The walls are imposed with a constant heat flux $q$.  
-> For simplicity, the velocity profile inside the pipe is assumed to be uniform, i.e. $u(x, y) = U$.  
-> All thermal and hydrodynamic properties (like $k$, $C_p$, $\rho$) are assumed to be constant.  
-> The diffusion in the $z$-direction is neglected.
