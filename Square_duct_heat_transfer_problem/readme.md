For this problem, I have considered a flow that is hydrodynamically and thermally fully developed inside a square duct (dimension of cross section: LxL). The walls are imposed with a constant heat flux "q". For simplicity, the velocity profile inside the pipe is assumed to be uniform, i.e. u(x, y) = $U$.
